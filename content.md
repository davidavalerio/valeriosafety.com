## Services Section

**Section Title:** What I Do

**Section Subtitle:** Eliminate hazards that cause serious harm and handle compliance with minimal overhead.

### Site Assessments

I identify high-energy hazards at your facilities—struck-by, caught-between, falls, vehicle accidents. The things that cause fatalities. You get specific recommendations for your operation, not a generic checklist that treats everything as equal risk.

### Training & Investigation

I train people to recognize hazards and make decisions in the field, not just collect completion certificates. When something goes wrong, I find systemic causes—not just a person to blame—and recommend changes that prevent recurrence.

### Safety Documentation

Job safety analyses, hazard assessments, and emergency response plans developed for how your crew actually works. A JSA that reflects your operation is useful. One downloaded from the internet is not.

### Compliance Partnership Note

For ISN, Veriforce, and Avetta platform management, I partner with Cook Compliance. I handle the safety work, they handle the compliance paperwork.

## About Section

**Name:** David Valerio

### Bio Paragraphs

I'm a safety guy who works with operators and contractors across the Williston Basin. I started Valerio Safety because too much of what passes for safety work is theater—rules that protect companies from regulators, not workers from hazards.

I take a different approach: focusing on high-energy hazards, the things that actually cause fatalities and serious injuries. I meet compliance obligations efficiently, but passing an inspection isn't the same as keeping people safe.

## Services Section

**Section Title:** What I Do

**Section Subtitle:** Eliminate what causes serious harm. Handle compliance with minimal overhead.

### Hazard Elimination

High-energy hazards cause fatalities. Struck-by, caught-between, falls, vehicle accidents. I focus there. The low-risk items that populate safety binders don't get my attention, and they shouldn't get yours either.

### Safety Programs

Job safety analyses, hazard assessments, and emergency response plans developed for your operation, not copied from a template. A JSA that describes what your crew actually does is useful, one downloaded from the internet is not.

### Training

Most safety training exists to generate completion certificates. I train people to recognize hazards and make decisions in the field. The certificate is a side effect.

### Incident Investigation

When something goes wrong, I find systemic causes—not just the person to blame. Most incident investigations produce paperwork. Mine produce changes that prevent recurrence.

### Compliance Partnership Note

For ISN, Veriforce, and Avetta platform management, I partner with Cook Compliance. I handle the safety work, they handle the compliance paperwork.

## About Section

**Name:** David Valerio

### Bio Paragraphs

I'm a safety guy based in Williston, North Dakota. I work with operators and contractors in upstream and midstream across the Williston Basin. I started Valerio Safety because I got tired of watching safety programs designed to satisfy lawyers instead of protect workers.

Too much of what passes for safety work is fake. Rules designed to protect regulators. Metrics that look rigorous but predict nothing. I take a different approach by focusing on eliminating high-energy hazards, the things that actually cause fatalities and serious injuries. I strive to meet compliance obligations efficiently, but don't confuse passing an audit with keeping people safe.
